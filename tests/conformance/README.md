# Conformance suite

The conformance suite is the executable contract for the v2 wire protocol. Any agent claiming to speak protocol version 2 must pass it.

## Running

Against a local agent on the default port:

```bash
pip install pytest
python tests/conformance/run.py 127.0.0.1
```

Against a remote agent:

```bash
python tests/conformance/run.py 192.168.1.42 8765
```

Or invoke `pytest` directly for fine-grained control:

```bash
pytest tests/conformance --host 192.168.1.42 --port 8765 -v
```

## What's tested

One file per namespace under `tests/conformance/`. Each test file:

- Skips its tests if the agent does not advertise the relevant verbs (per `system.capabilities`).
- Uses the `client` fixture (observe tier), the `drive_client` fixture (elevated to drive — needs `--token-path`), or the `power_client` fixture (elevated to power) as appropriate.

## Token elevation

Tier-raising tests read the agent's elevation token from `%ProgramData%\AgentRemoteHands\token` by default. Override with `--token-path` or the `REMOTE_HANDS_TOKEN_PATH` environment variable. Tests that need elevated tiers are skipped if the token file is unreadable.

## What's not tested

- **Actual synthetic input** (`input.click`, `input.type`, etc.). These are tier-gated tested but exercising real input would visibly perturb the host running the suite. Manual / interactive testing covers that.
- **Actual reboot / shutdown / logoff.** Tier-gated tested.
- **EVENT-frame delivery for `watch.*`.** The subscription-registration path is tested; verifying real event delivery requires deliberate triggers (process spawn-and-die, etc.) which the harness does not currently orchestrate.

## Adding a verb

When wire-protocol changes land:

1. Update `PROTOCOL.md` (the canonical spec).
2. Implement the verb in `agents/<target>/...`.
3. Add a test case in the appropriate `test_<namespace>.py` (or a new file for a new namespace).
4. The test SHOULD use `needs_verb(capabilities, "<verb>")` so older agents that don't implement it are skipped, not failed.
